## Overview

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

**Challenge:** Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text

User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow

User story: I can choose to disable the button

User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)

User story: I can have different button sizes

User story: I can have different colors

User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators

User story: I can still access all button attributes

User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

_Challenge is still WIP so this will be updated frequently during development. _

This branch is the second attempt at the same button component but this time with a better understanding of the user stories of the challenge.

So the top button is the only one that actually changes state and the rest of the buttons below change the state of hte top button based on the type of button user clicks.
